This document explains how you should use the course repository during the semester.
Each week new tasks will be published by the instructor in the upstream repository.
Your job is to keep your forked repository up to date and document your own solutions.

1. Fork the Repository
Go to the dedicated repository on GitHub.
Click the Fork button in the top-right corner.
A copy of the repository will be created under your own GitHub account.
2. Clone the Repository
Use Codespaces (recommended) → click Code → Codespaces → Create codespace.

3. Structure of the Repository
labs/L8, labs/L9, … – folders with weekly tasks.
solution_L8.md, solution_L9.md, … – files where you describe your solutions.
4. Documenting Your Work
For every lab session: 1. Open the corresponding solution_XX.md file. 2. Describe what you did: Short explanation (2–3 sentences). 3. Provide Screenshots with:

Your GitHub username visible in the workflow name.
Browser address bar visible.
At least one screenshot of your Codespaces terminal with your login.
4. Save and commit your changes.
Example commit:

git add labs/L8/solution_L8.md
git commit -m "L8: completed Exercise A"
git push origin main
Of couse you can use VS Code UI in Codespaces to update your files and make commits.

5. Submission
After finishing the lab, push your changes to your fork on GitHub.
Copy the link to your fork (e.g., https://github.com/username/course-repo).
Paste this link into the Moodle assignment for the current lab.
6. Updating Your Fork Weekly
Each week the instructor will add new tasks to the main course repository. To update your fork: - Go to your fork on GitHub. - Click Sync fork → Update branch. - Refresh the page – new tasks will appear in your fork.

7. Rules
Always keep your solutions in your forked repository.
Do not change or delete task descriptions.
Commits should be created during lab time – commit timestamps are used for verification.
Each solution_XX.md file must include your documentation with screenshots.
